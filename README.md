This project is a full-stack application built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Deployment on Render

### Frontend Deployment
1. Ensure that the `vite.config.js` file is configured correctly for production.
2. Build the frontend by running:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to Render.

### Backend Deployment
1. Ensure that all environment variables are set in the Render dashboard.
2. Start the backend server by running:

3. Ensure that the backend is configured to connect to the database and any other services.

### Environment Variables
